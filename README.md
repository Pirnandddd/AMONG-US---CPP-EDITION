# AMONG-US---CPP-EDITION

This pandemic brought me fresh ideas and concepts about the beauty of technology and the life itself. While on quarantine, people found new ways on how to socialize with each other and one of them is Among Us. The highly addictive and funny game called Among Us is one of those games that captured the lives of many in this quarantine and it surely scattered like wildfire around the world. Becoming a global trend, I decided to have fun with it!

So yeah, I recreated the world-famous Among Us game using just C++! Though I did a lot of tweaks in my version compared to the original one, I made sure that the Among Us vibe is still in my rendition like chatting with the crew and completing tasks.

Instructions on how to play the game:
1. Start the game by pressing start.
2. Input your name.
3. Have fun completing tasks.
4. If prompted by an impostor's sabotage; whether minor or major, the task progress will decrease.
5. Now it's your chance to have a chat with the 'bots'. If you mention a wrong color, your crew trust will decrease. If your crew trust is 0, you are defeated. If you skip, game over. If you mention the right one, you're the victor.
