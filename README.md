# AMONG-US---CPP-EDITION
I recreated the almighty famous Among Us game using just C++!

Notes:
1. Install the VS Code essentials, so C+++ can work properly lol
2. The options from the game menu are pretty basic that you can understand what is "Start".
3. You can improve my code, play around with it using the Sandbox branch, or you can create your own branch.
